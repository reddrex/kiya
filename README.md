These are the files for an NLP university course project where we developed an AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language) conversational agent. Its purpose is to serve as a PoC (Proof of Concept) for an AI assistant that helped the Spanish-speaking elderly navigate their questions when interacting with mobile devices.

We followed an adapted version of the [IThaKA pattern design](https://zenodo.org/records/18237644), leaving out the dual index structure of common and specific knowledge, as we weren't going to reuse the chatbot and it was a small PoC that wasn't going to have much personality (common knowledge).

## FAQ

#### What do I need for it to work?

Because of the diversity of skills in the team, we deployed the files in Pandorabots. However, you just need an AIML interpreter for our files to work with your project. You can easily use libraries that support AIML 2.0/2.1 that must support the sets, maps and such that Pandorabots uses; e.g. pyaiml21 in Python or Program AB in Java.

#### Can I reuse your project?

Sure, just give us a heads up + mention our project! We would love to see it grow and turn into something.
